# Hotels

> [Open Source Bridge 2016](http://opensourcebridge.org/wiki/2016/Hotels) created a fantastic hotel guide, which we will annotate below.

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1ROb_8PlZLRqQIpxNRDsru75ldfk" width="640" height="480"></iframe>

[Hotel deLuxe](http://www.hoteldeluxeportland.com/) is a very classy hotel with an excellent bar, [The Driftwood Room](http://www.hoteldeluxeportland.com/eat-drink/driftwood-room/).

[Ace Hotel Portland](http://www.acehotel.com/portland) is centrally located, and is literally on top of coffee, food, and drink. They have a photobooth in the lobby for immortalizing your new csv,conf,v3 friendships.

[Hotel Monaco](http://www.monaco-portland.com/) is a comfortable Kimpton hotel with great staff. Danielle has stayed here and had a wonderful experience.

[Hotel Modera](http://www.hotelmodera.com/) OHSU often puts visiting speakers up here and we have been told it's fun and comfortable. [Nel Centro](http://www.nelcentro.com/menus/), Modera's restaurant and bar, has a large outdoor seating area with fire pits.

[Jupiter Hotel](https://jupiterhotel.com/) is right next to the [Doug Fir](http://www.dougfirlounge.com/calendar/), an iconic Portland music venue. This may make it more or less appealing to you depending on who is playing. Potentially worth it just for the log-themed decor in the Doug Fir. Walkable to restaurants and shops along East Burnside.

[The Heathman](http://portland.heathmanhotel.com/) has their employees wear a [distinctive costume](https://goo.gl/images/DskmLq) so be nice to them if you stay there. Danielle has heard the attached restaurant is good, but she can not personally vouch for it.

# Airbnb

Do you prefer apartments to hotels? Do you want to pretend you live in Portland? Get out of downtown and rent an Airbnb in a neighborhood.

## Neighborhoods

[Portland is organized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_of_Portland,_Oregon) into four quadrants - SW, NW, SE, NE (and North Portland, which is the fifth quadrant, that's just how we do it). Burnside divides North and South, and the Willamette River (said in a way that rhymes with "damnit") divides East and West.  North Portland is North of Burnside, east of the Willamete, and west of I-5. The Elliot Center is in SW Portland. Below are some neighborhoods to check out.

## NW 23rd
North of Burnside along NW 23rd Ave, this is a lively area with a mix of local and chain shops. Charming apartments. 1-2 miles from the venue, ~30 min walk or streetcar or ~15 min bus ride. Cat level: Medium.

## The Pearl

North of Burnside and east of the 405, mainly loft and condo apartments. Gentrified in the 90s, this used to be a warehouse district. Now it's home to many bars and restaurants. This is where you'd go out to dinner with your boss or your parents.  ~1 mile from the Elliot center, walkable or take the streetcar. **Warning: No cats.**

## SE Belmont and Division

Cat, brunch and coffee paradise. Full of charming houses and apartments. Food-cart central.  Look for places in Sunnyside, Richmond, Division, Belmont, and Hawthorne neighborhoods or search the Zip Code 97214. Bike or ~25 min bus ride to the venue.

#### Notable cats in this area

## N Mississippi

Still lots of cats and bars, Eater breaks it down [here](http://pdx.eater.com/maps/dining-guide-to-north-mississippi-avenue-portland-neighborhood). Home to [Mississippi Studios](http://www.mississippistudios.com/) and an outpost of Blue Star Doughnuts, ~30-40 min bus ride to venue.

## NE Alberta

Lots of cats, bars and brunch. Charming, walkable neighborhood but further out from the venue.


# Transportation

[The Streetcar](https://portlandstreetcar.org/) - It's slow! But sometimes it's better than walking if it happens to be going where you need to go. Separate tickets from the bus and MAX.

[The Bus and the MAX](http://trimet.org/)
MAX - a cool light rail named after Max Ogden. Goes from the Airport to Downtown (Red line). The bus is reasonably reliable and you can track you bus' arrival time with the Trimet app. Important because during off-peak hours, the busses run less frequently.

[Trimet Tickets app](https://trimet.org/app/) - Ride the bus or the MAX with interchangeable passes, pay once for a two hour window of as much public transportation you can get, just show the driver your ticket on your phone when you get on.

[Biketown app](https://www.biketownpdx.com/) - Portland's orange bicycle share. Sponsored by Nike, and definitely pronounced 'Bike-town' as if it was 'Nike-town'

Both Lyft and Uber operate in Portland. You can also call a [Radio Cab](http://radiocab.net/#/booking/).
