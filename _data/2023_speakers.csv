awilliams,Adrienne Williams,Data Is Power: How Unpaid labor & Stolen Data Train Amazon’s Technology & How Workers Can Take Their Power & Their Money Back.,"Amazon uses sensors in delivery vans and collects data through the Mentor app and company-issued scanners. Mentor is mandatory.  It monitors “risky” driving and distraction behind the wheel. Drivers are required to complete unpaid homework based on perceived “mistakes” determined by Mentor. Low scores means uninsurable drivers. Most drivers download the app onto personal phones instead of the company-provided scanners provided. To download the app onto one's personal phone means employees must allow Mentor to run in the background…always. In this talk, I will draw on my experience as a former Amazon delivery driver and organizer to discuss how tools implemented by Amazon to surveil its workers are, at the same time, used to collect workers' data and train future surveillance systems. This creates a vicious cycle that negatively affects workers. In my talk, I will describe how Amazon’s priorities shape the data that is collected, and how workers develop collective and individual strategies to trick the surveillance systems and regain control of the data that is collected from them.",https://www.dair-institute.org/about,,adrienneandgp,,

achowdhary,Anand Chowdhary,Running a Covid-19 nonprofit as a data maker,"In 2020, Anand Chowdhary and his team founded Karuna 2020, a nonprofit that distributed masks and food to migrant laborers and frontline workers in India. Using GitHub Actions, we developed several open-sourced workflows that automate tasks like generating open data APIs. For example, for every ration kit we distributed, we uploaded a face-blurred photo of the recipient and our REST API tells donors exactly where we're spending the money. All of this was built using Airtable, GitHub Actions, and CSV spreadsheets. In this talk, fellow data makers will learn about how we used automated processes for complete data transparency and the tooling we developed for running a nonprofit.",https://anandchowdhary.com/anand.png,AnandChowdhary,AnandChowdhary,,
aanand,Apoorv Anand,A community driven initiative to crowdsource background details of 1700 High Court Judges in India,"India, the world's largest democracy, has a complex judicial system. The judgments delivered by courts touch upon almost every aspect of an individual's life. Despite playing a critical role, there is barely any data available on the background of judges in these courts. This information is crucial in building and sustaining public trust in the judicial process. It is also critical to inform about potential bias and conflicts of interest. The conceptualization of this dataset was a response to this information gap in India's judicial architecture.
We launched a campaign to build a public dataset titled Know Your High Court Judges (KHOJ) (https://justicehub.in/initiatives/khoj-india) to curate background information on judges. Over 15 months, we collected data on 43 variables on the judge's demographic, education, work experience, judicial appointments, transfers, etc. More than 30 students from law universities across the country, collaborated on crowd-sourcing data from court websites, and other publicly available documents on official websites.
In this talk, I would like to discuss: 
1. The story behind the conceptualization of this dataset
2 - The crucial roles played by members of the Justice Hub (https://justicehub.in/) community 
3 - The process of curating data and ensuring the accuracy of data points (collected by volunteers who had little to no background in working with data or technology) 
4 - Our learnings about how collaborative data curation processes can be used to collect data on other governance-related indicators that are not readily available and difficult to access through the Right to Information Act. 
5 - How this dataset has been contributing to building a discourse around transparency in judicial decision-making.",https://civicdatalab.in/team/apoorv,https://github.com/apoorv74,,,

In the course of investigating this and other systemic failures of the accountability system, we built a public database ( http://LLEAD.co ) and we cultivated a network of real-world practitioners who can put this tool to work on a day-to-day basis by using it to: defend individual members of the public against wrongful convictions ( https://ip-no.org ) , illustrate the mechanics of police impunity ( https://copwatchnola.wordpress.com ) , and advocate for meaningful changes on the policy level and beyond.

bgreshaketzovaras,Bastian Greshake Tzovaras,"Nothing about us, without us: Participatory approaches to make data by the people for the people","Data and AI have by now entered most – if not all – aspects of our lives, from the social over health to the workplace. With this datafication come myriad ethical questions: Which data should (and should not) be collected? What are acceptable uses for those data? And importantly, who gets to decide on these questions? More often than not, these questions are neither posed to nor answered by the people most affected by the data collection and might only be asked once harm has been done. Participatory approaches such as citizen science can be used to give those affected a voice by involving them right from the start and provides a pathway to improving data justice more broadly. This talk will give concrete examples to highlight how participation in fields such as transgender healthcare, Autism research and chronic diseases have been implemented and not only solved some of these issues, but also lead to better and more impactful research as a result. Furthermore, we will give a set of recommendations and ideas on how to start implementing such approaches in your own data practice.",https://tzovar.as/assets/images/profile.jpg,gedankenstuecke,gedankenstuecke,,

,Esha Datta,What are you? Automating journal subject classification,"Traditionally, journal subject classification was done manually at varying levels of granularity, depending on the use case for the institution. Automating classification work surfaces questions about the relevance of the taxonomy used, the potential bias that might exist, and the texts being classified. Currently, journals are classified using various taxonomies and are siloed in many systems such as library databases or software for publishers. Providing a service that can automatically classify (and provide a measure of accuracy!) a text outside of a specific system can democratize access of this information across all systems. Crossref provides a range of services to the research community; we have a wealth of metadata deposited by the community. We wondered how we could contribute in this area. I will be talking about the ways in which I processed journal metadata, generated features based on that, ran machine learning models, measured their accuracy, and experimented with word and sentence embedding with Allen AI’s Scibert and other deep learning models. As a work in progress, I look forward to sharing more details in the talk, including the efficacy of the automated system in place as well as talking about the taxonomies investigated so far.",,eshadatta-crossref,,,

When we work with data, we handle different versions of our databases, graphics and code files. This can result in disorganized and difficult to access projects, so when we use project templates we can automate this repetitive work by creating files and folders structured in a certain way to help us easily locate the different sections and standardize our projects. At the same time we can also automate more complex proceedings that we have incorporated in our workflows, such as installing certain libraries, starting git repositories, creating virtual environments, among many other possibilities.

fakara,Florence Akara,Inclusive data narratives - decolonising data for Africa,"Universal access to data and tech can only be achieved by engaging from the bottom up. The challenge, however, lies in the narrative it holds for many Africans, particularly in rural areas. Colonization taught our African forefathers to survive, and this was passed down through generations. To openly engage with tech and data is not a usual thing in our community, the survival mode is to prevent it from infiltrating our communities, particularly the rural ones. Tech and data are categorised as skilled professions, and many, even myself, find ourselves apprehensive about the potential threats, and weaknesses we could expose ourselves by engaging in it. In East Africa, people are daily victims of data infringements and fraud, women in particular. It doesn't help that most data and tech programs are often led by non-locals and men; ineffectively distancing the women, and local communities from feeling like active participants or collaborators in any tech or data agendas. Because they are often expensive, data and tech are perceived as inaccessible for the lower economic communities, and a luxury for most people in general. Governments themselves don't have adequate resources to properly train and engage local communities, which means its access is inevitably limited. The lack of locally accessible, free or affordable data and tech, fails to match the need for legitimate equitable access. This results in fewer people engaging in data, because of a lack of adequate information to make informed decisions about the type of data they are comfortable sharing, its storage and usage - outweighing much interest in engaging in it. Sharing stories, and developing a new narrative for data inclusion in Africa, abolishing the hierarchies of who can use data, by enabling local actors to equally access them without cost barriers. Spotlighting women and girls in particular, engaging without fear of online exploitation, or abuse, prioritising feminist values so they do not shy from self-marketing, and building their capacity so they can adopt it to their communities, will alleviate a significant barrier to the data inclusion agenda. Better access to tech and data will result in significant improvements to impact investment and achieve SDG impact. My initiative, collabo254 is working to invest in local organisational development, ensuring that their capacity, particularly in updating its use of basic, free tech tools to collect data. Designed from my own experience running a nonprofit for over 5 years, and forced to learn to self-design from google suites tools and another free basic tech, to fit our local team needs, and user challenges and align with our model of reporting to better manage records of our impact without breaking the bank. The idea is to make data and tech not appear as threatening and work with local faces and names, so that communities can see themselves represented in data spaces, to alleviate the fear of actively engaging.",,,FemmeInt,,

grosati,Germán Rosati,Land use trajectories as text data,"How does land use change over time? Can agrarian frontier expansion and deforestation be detected in high resolution images over a long period of time? This question has implications in both environmental and socio-economic dimensions. Since the publication of large government databases derived from processed satellite images, new analytical and methodological approaches have emerged
Problems of this kind are usually addressed by aggregating information at higher levels (municipalities, departments, administrative areas). For this talk we propose another approach: to work at the pixel level. We will represent each land use pixel sequence over time as if it were a word. This makes it possible to use the so-called “edit distances” (which measure the number of operations necessary to transform one sequence into another) and to generate a matrix that allows clustering land use trajectories using simple techniques. 
We will present an illustration of this procedure covering the 1992-2020 period in Argentina (excluding Patagonia region), using information from the European Space Agency and Dynamic World. Our main goal is to obtain a map with the highest possible resolution that shows the following situations: 1) areas of recent expansion of the agrarian frontier; 2) areas of “consolidated” agriculture and 3) areas of recent urban expansion.

Más recientemente, distintos organismos han comenzado a promover estos valores desde el desarrollo de políticas públicas y la financiación de proyectos Sin embargo, estas medidas varían mucho dependiendo de la región. Un instrumento posible para la difusión de la ciencia abierta, potencialmente con más aceptación de los usuarios, son las comunidades de práctica, grupos auto-organizados y auto-mantenidos de personas que comparten una preocupación o pasión por algo que hacen y aprenden a hacerlo mejor a medida que interactúan con regularidad. Se ha observado un gran crecimiento de estas comunidades en los últimos años en Latinoamérica, muchas dirigidas a reducir la brecha de género en STEAM como R-Ladies, PyLadies, GeoChicas, TecnoLatinas y Women in Bioinformatics and Data Science Latin America, otras enfocadas en transmitir habilidades para enseñar herramientas computacionales como The Carpentries o dedicadas a enseñar herramientas y prácticas de ciencia abierta como MetaDocencia. En este contexto, nos preguntamos cuál es el rol de las comunidades de práctica en la difusión e implementación de prácticas de ciencia abierta en general, y específicamente, en la región de Latinoamérica. Para ello, realizamos un análisis exploratorio de la evolución del uso de los términos “ciencia abierta” y “open science” con el tiempo de 2012 a la actualidad.

khoeberling,Katie Hoeberling,The role of data in addressing environmental and climate injustice,"Around the world, communities organize to address environmental pollution and respond to climate change. Data can provide support, prompting us to frame questions from new perspectives, emphasizing place-based stories and experiences, and connecting the broad range of people and institutions responsible for environmental governance and stewardship. But the barriers to data uptake are enormous – data collected by regulatory agencies, researchers, or mandated industry requirements are decontextualized. They do not adequately reflect local values and cultural knowledge that may be critically important to policy or regulatory change. On the other hand, communities must navigate complex laws and policies within dense legal landscapes before effectively sharing their data and experiences. This talk will explore the conditions necessary for making environmental data usable beyond its original intent, strengthening multi-directional flows to tell new stories and build informed solutions that center communities bearing the brunt of pollution and climate change. It will do so by highlighting efforts which are attempting to integrate community data in research and government decisions, and to make regulatory data more accessible to researchers, journalists, community organizations, lawyers, and others. We’ll discuss mechanisms and strategies for shifting social, political, and technical systems toward creating environmental governance and stewardship processes that work across sectors.

kbadger,Kelsey Badger,Data Management on the Front Lines: Managing Administrative Data at the Source,"Over the past decade, it has become increasingly common that funders require researchers to submit a data management plan detailing how data produced during the project will be documented, secured, and shared. However, there is no equivalent requirement for managing government data that is “born-administrative”, even if it is commonly used downstream for research purposes. This has resulted in an uneven patchwork of government data management practices that greatly impact the accessibility and usability of administrative data for both its original purposes and in any subsequent re-use. This talk will explore this challenge through the example of child welfare electronic case records in the United States. This data is a particularly complex case study due to both its sensitivity and the distributed nature of the child welfare service system, which relies heavily on privatized contractors. This creates a correspondingly long tail of data management needs that are often not addressed by top-down data governance policies. How can data management practices be incorporated earlier in child welfare data collection without further burdening overworked frontline staff? Are there lessons to be learned from the last decade of teaching researchers how to better manage their data? And whose responsibility is all this anyway?

lburin,Laia Domenech Burin,#Menstruacción: How much does it cost to menstruate?,"EcoFeminita (https://ecofeminita.com/) is a non-profit civil association which aims to show and address gender inequality by disseminating data, statistics, academic content and original research targeting all audiences. For this talk, I’d like to present our report called “How much does it cost to menstruate?”, which estimates the annual cost of menstrual management products —pads and tampons— based on data obtained through web scraping the government's open-data source Precios Claros (https://www.preciosclaros.gob.ar/). This report is done in the context of the #MenstruAcción campaign, which attempts to accomplish two main goals. Firstly, to expose the importance of providing menstrual management products for free, since they are a basic healthcare element to which not all the population have access. Secondly, to break down the menstruation taboo and promote research and socialization of data about this topic. My talk will address the main demands of the campaign, and the importance of using data in order to fight inequality. I will also explain our open-data methodology, the results of our report, and the recent challenges we’ve been facing due to the lack of transparency of Precios Claros.",,ecofeminita,ecofeminita,,

laalemany,Laura Alonso Alemany,Auditoría de sesgos para todos: avanzando en el territorio,"Los sistemas de toma de decisiones automatizados (recomendadores automáticos, clasificadores de riesgo crediticio, sistemas de reconocimiento de imágenes, traductores, entre otros) involucran aspectos cada vez más importantes de nuestras vidas, afectando incluso derechos humanos. Por esta razón, auditarlos se convierte en una necesidad. Sin embargo, los sistemas que involucran componentes de inteligencia artificial resultan especialmente difíciles de auditar, sobretodo en los casos en los que aplican aprendizaje automático, ya que suelen resultar opacos e ininteligibles para la persona que los inspecciona. Desde ámbitos académicos se han propuesto numerosos métodos para auditar estos sistemas, pero la mayor parte de propuestas involucran complejidades técnicas que excluyen a personas con experiencia relevante para la auditoría, como experiencia en discrimnación o en los contextos de aplicación de las tecnologías. En esta charla queremos presentar una herramienta y una metodología para facilitar el involucramiento de personas expertas, pero sin habilidades técnicas específicas, en la auditoría de sesgos de tecnologías del lenguaje. Describiremos cómo conceptualizamos los métodos de inspección de estas tecnologías poniendo el foco en las personas con experiencias relevantes, y haciendo transparentes las complejidades técnicas. Relataremos dos experiencias prácticas con personas expertas en muy diferentes tipos de sesgos y discriminaciones, que mostraron buena viabilidad de la herramienta. Finalmente, detallaremos nuestros planes a futuro: consolidar la herramienta como una librería de software, recopilar, disponibilizar y visibilizar recursos lingüísticos que permitan sistematizar el análisis de sesgos locales, en colaboración con equipos internacionales con los mismos objetivos, y finalmente impulsar la adopción de la metodología asociada a esta herramienta en organizaciones y empresas de nuestro entorno.

mhirsch,Mary Hirsch,Open research needs open (meta)data,"Metadata plays a key role in the scientific publication and dissemination process. It is only through metadata and identifiers that each contribution, from research data to article publication and beyond, becomes findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Persistent identifiers (PIDs) and their metadata are the backbone of scholarly communications, since only through them can the promise of sustainable access to research information be realized. This presentation will highlight the importance of open metadata in scholarly communications to recognize a wide range of contributions to science and as a way to build trust in research. We will also discuss the need for collaborative, community efforts to improve metadata creation and dissemination. Examples of organizations and researchers using open metadata will be presented.",,,,,
mtunga,Mahadia Tunga,Using Verbal Autopsy data to predict out-of-hospital causes of death,"Did you know that over 50% of people worldwide die outside health facilities? Thus, their cause of death is not known. Verbal autopsy(VA) is the survey-based method to determine symptoms or signs the deceased experienced before death. Using VA data and machine learning techniques, we can predict causes of death in areas where other forms of the autopsy are unavailable or not affordable such as in Low-income settings where more than 30% of people die outside health facilities. Having quality and adequate data on causes of death is important in understanding conditions of morbidity, which is an important aspect of quality healthcare interventions. I have developed a machine learning model to determine causes of death using bayesian networks.",https://theodi.org/person/mahadia-tunga/,,TungaMahadia,,

nbentley,Nokome Bentley,"Trust but verify: combining GPTs and CRDTs to empower researchers and
deter fraudsters","Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in
generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) and other large language
models (LLMs), have the potential to increase the productivity of
researchers many times over. However, alongside the benefits of AI
comes the risk that these technologies could also accelerate the
creation of fraudulent scientific content. There is a growing concern
that we are on the verge of a deluge of ""deep fakes"" in academic
publishing, where AI-generated articles can easily deceive readers and
reviewers alike.

Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are data structures that
allow for concurrent changes to a shared document across multiple
nodes without requiring constant coordination between them. CRDTs
enable real-time, distributed collaboration and version control
without relying on a centralized server. In most CRDT implementations,
each change to the document is accompanied by a unique identifier
representing the actor that made the change.

In this talk, I introduce an approach to scientific authoring that
combines the power of GPTs and CRDTs, allowing researchers to make use
of the capabilities of AI while improving the verifiability of
research provenance and integrating with established formats and tools
such as Jupyter Notebooks, Microsoft Word, and JATS XML.",,stencila,nokomebentley,,

rsefala,Raesetje Sefala,Constructing a Visual Dataset to Study the Effects of Spatial Apartheid in South Africa,"Over 27 years ago in South Africa, the Apartheid government forced non-European people to leave urban areas into neighborhoods like townships where they were marginalized in a controlled manner through laws and unfair budget constraints. In post-apartheid South Africa we still see no developments in townships and it is not easy to analyse what is happening in because in official government data like the census, the government lumps townships and suburbs together into a category known as formal residential neighborhoods. This masks the presence of townships, and prevents us from understanding whether or not they are changing after apartheid.  We created datasets that map all townships in South Africa together with these we use satellite imagery and machine learning techniques to analyse the evolution of neighborhoods post-apartheid. Even though apartheid has legally ended, photos show that townships are still very visibly different from suburbs. Our work segments out townships and analyses how they have changed over time, overlaying other datasets like government resource allocation data, there are disparities with urban areas. We give a few examples of what we’ve found, discuss our methodology, and talk about what we hope to do in the future.",https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQF2sPdLw5aoAw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1648848820091?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=HC4D2G-Acw6XirVtdY0dB-LwrBAOc1RNj1n_ZLJ4vk4,sefalab,bonjora,,
