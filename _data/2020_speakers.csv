rkemper,Rudo Kemper,Mapping and safeguarding indigenous oral histories using an open source tool,"For many indigenous and other local communities in the rainforests of South America, survival in the rainforest has always depended on an intimate knowledge of their territory, passed down by their ancestors. Place-based stories help determine where food or resources are located, or where dangers lie hidden. Most importantly, the oral histories reinforce their historical and cultural connection to their homelands, which in turn informs their collective identity. However, in the contemporary context, oral history storytelling traditions are at risk of disappearing as younger community members leave their villages recurrently or permanently, in search of work. To prevent invaluable oral histories from disappearing into oblivion, we developed a methodology and built a FOSS application to help communities map their oral histories. Terrastories was born in 2018 after realizing the need for an offline-first geostorytelling tool that can work in very remote conditions such as the Amazon rainforest, and give communities the power to manage their own traditional knowledge and storytelling data. I will share how the project was born and why indigenous peoples needed this tool, how Terrastories works, and discuss some tough questions around data sovereignty, protection of sensitive data, and archiving traditional knowledge.",http://www.amazonteam.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/rudo.jpg,rudokemper,rudokemper
gshayden,Gabriele S Hayden,The cultural meaning of programming languages,"Human languages develop over time a set of cultural associations. For example, during the early and mid-twentieth century, the Spanish language in the United States was seen both as a European high literary language and as a language associated with femininity and racial mixture. In my dissertation work, I documented how US modernist poets who translated from Spanish used or resisted those associations as they intervened in controversies over race and style in twentieth century poetics. Coding languages, too, can take on gendered and raced cultural associations. This talk explores the changing cultural associations of coding languages and how those cultural associations were expressed in changing coding styles or conventions. It draws on the work of Vikram Chandra (Geek Sublime) and other writers exploring the cultural meanings and stylistic associations of computer code.",https://library.uoregon.edu/users/ghayden,gabrielesh,@reprofan

Rivers are of particular interest due to their complex dynamics, importance to water supply and security, and ubiquity across the Earth's surface. We wanted to build a global dataset of the Earth's rivers in order to understand how changing river patterns may be linked to global climate. To achieve this we used data collected by Space Shuttle Endeavour, combined with open source geospatial tools, and high performance computing to sample the properties of over 300,000 of the world's rivers.

This will cover the widespread use of the W3C DCAT metadata standard across all Federal agencies as well as widespread use by state and local governments. This same metadata also helps generate the Schema.org variant of the specification with fuels listings on general purpose platforms like Google Dataset Search. The European Union has been updating their DCAT Application Profile with the recent development of DCAT 2.0 and the US Government will be revising its DCAT specification to meet updated requirements in the new comprehensive open data law (""Evidence Act"") with public input on GitHub. This talk will provide an overview of the current state of this infrastructure and ecosystem and ponder how other metadata standards including CSVW, Tabular Data Packages, DSPL, and SDMX fit into the mix as well as how we can better leverage CSVs and tabular data tools and capabilities within platforms like Data.gov and other CKAN-based data catalogs. Since this talk should be in the midst of the public comment period for revising our USG-focused profile of DCAT, it will also be a good opportunity to solicit comments and public participation in the update to the metadata specification used across all government agencies.

They also have a lot of aging junk: little-used datasets with cryptic titles and scant documentation. The library domain has years of experience “weeding” out under-used or outdated materials, and our team brought that perspective to the Washington State open data portal (data.wa.gov/browse). But weeding open data turned out to be pretty complicated. What counts as “low quality” or “little” use? Who makes the weeding decision, in a publishing environment that’s usually decentralized and managed anonymously? How do portals, created for transparency, remove content in a transparent way? We examined nearly all U.S. state and many U.S. city government portals and found very few formal data removal policies -- a void that raises questions about authority, usability and management, as many civic data portals enter their second decade. Supported by the Open Data Literacy project (https://odl.ischool.uw.edu/), this work is contributing to a new open data curation partnership between the Washington State Library and the state’s data portal.

jpevans,James Perry Evans,Protected health information breaches on GitHub,"Medical scientists are encouraged to use GitHub for software development, but without training, they might leak protected health information (PHI) by inadvertently including data in what should be software-only repositories. During the fall of 2016, we attempted to identify obvious breaches of PHI on GitHub as part of an ongoing interest in patient privacy. Searching GitHub for keywords patient, dob, and ssn uncovered hundreds of repositories, which were further scanned for sensitive information (names, organizations, phone numbers, street addresses, credit cards, IPs, SSNs, and emails) using Python's common regex module and the Stanford Natural Language Toolkit. Manual investigation of the results uncovered four repositories that exposed patient information. 1) A popular health care provider exposed approximately 4000 patient names. On Dec 1, we were able to track down the healthcare provider from both the repository name and doctor names in the repository files. We contacted the organization and those repositories were taken down within the day of contact. 2) A health collection agency’s repository led to the exposure of social security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses, email addresses, and insurance and billing information of roughly 30,000 patients. After we contacted the repository owner, the data and the repository were removed from GitHub some six months after the data had first been exposed. 3) A crisis center’s long-term breach of PHI was discovered in August 2016, and from the repository commit dates, it had been up for at least three years. The original repository managed the medical records application developed for the crisis center. We contacted that organization and the repository was taken down within a few days. 4) A contractor for a health insurance wellness program leaked some patient data with names, social security numbers, addresses, and health measures such as blood pressure. This organization was contacted by our hospital compliance office and the GitHub repository was removed. Our talk will cover the discovery of these PHI breaches, and how we handled them with GitHub, our hospital compliance office, and the organizations involved.",https://photos.app.goo.gl/nmC2J5QLdg6B1LL57,samesense,oncolytic

However, in practice there are many dynamics to data analysis that contribute to the determination of whether an analysis is ‘successful’ or not, many of which exists outside of the data itself. This is why the same regression model can be accepted as ‘successful’ in one context but not in another. Understanding the interplays between data and different factors can help analysts strategize to deliver a ‘successful’ analysis, such as applying design-thinking, storytelling, and empathy techniques. Many discussions within the data community have taken place regarding these techniques and its importance, but few have discuss the ethical impact of such techniques – what are the implications if an analysis crafted through a specific lens is ‘successful’?

I will briefly show some of our recent efforts at BCO-DMO which include a data access API, and a data processing and provenance capture tool called Laminar which uses frictionless datapackage pipelines and was built during a pilot project with the Open Knowledge Foundation.",https://directory.whoi.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/amber_profile_crop.jpg,adyork ,@amber_science and @BCODMO
cgosnell_pvirgo,Christina Gosnell and Pablo Virgo,Getting climate advocates the data they need,"When it comes to electricity regulation a little data can go a long way. There is a wealth of data about the US electric system, but unfortunately it is not accessible, clean or connected. The Catalyst Cooperative collates and analyzes data to help advocates close coal power plants. We’d like to share what we’ve learned about how open source data can further the policy conversation around clean energy, using real data and examples from our work.

ycalberro,Yosune Chamizo Alberro,Sinapsis (Synapses): a piece of software that promotes the use of open data to discover connections between illegal companies that received public resources by corrupt governments in Latin America,"Mexico it’s an extremely corrupt country where politicians steal money without sanctions. Both in our country and in many others in Latin America the modus operandi is similar: government official create ghost companies, the government assigns projects to these fake businesses and the money disappears. How can we detect these companies? Animal Político (the news media in which I work) revealed The Master Scam investigation, where it was shown how the Federal Government disappeared 7,670 million pesos (around 400 million dollars) through 186 companies. This investigation won the National Journalism Award and would not have been possible without the use of Sinapsis. Sinapsis is an interactive tool to visualize relationships between businesses and government entities. The users will be able to see how companies and their personnel are interconnected. As a free, open-source project, Sinapsis is designed to help journalists, researchers, academic scholars, or students detect irregularities and suspicious or questionable activity in business interactions and practices.

eriederer,Emily Riederer,RMarkdown Driven Development,"RMarkdown enables analysts to engage with code interactively, embrace literate programming, and rapidly produce a wide variety of high-quality data products such as documents, emails, dashboards, and websites. However, RMarkdown is less commonly explored and celebrated for the important role it can play in helping R users grow into developers. In this talk, I will provide an overview of RMarkdown Driven Development: a workflow for converting one-off analysis into a well-engineered and well-designed R package with deep empathy for user needs. We will explore how the methodical incorporation of good coding practices such as modularization and testing naturally evolves a single-file RMarkdown into an R project or package. Along the way, we will discuss big-picture questions like “optimal stopping” (why some data products are better left as single files or projects) and concrete details such as the {here} and {testthat} packages which can provide step-change improvements to project sustainability.",https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chircollab/chircollab.github.io/master/img/team/emily-riederer.jpg,emilyriederer,emilyriederer
wwong,Wendy Wong,On using AutoML to predict clinical outcomes,"AutoML allows users to create high-quality machine learning models to solve real-world problems without much coding. Recently, Automl has been used in machine learning competitions such as Kaggle and showed excellent performance. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether AutoML can be utilized for biologists who have little experience with machine learning can use AutoML to gain insights from their data.  In this study, I will re-analyze a case-control gene expression data set with open-source AutoML frameworks. I will compare the frameworks on their performance on creating a predictive model for disease using biomarkers from the expression data. I will demonstrate how to keep track of models and their hyperparameters using MLflow. Finally, I will attempt to gain insights by integrating information from explainable AI tools such as DALEX and biological pathways for gene set enrichment analysis.

lfederer,Lisa Federer,Data and Code for Reproducible Research,"The National Library of Medicine held two workshops in 2019 in which National Institutes of Health researchers attempted to reproduce the results of published bioinformatics paper that stated they made their data and code publicly available. Not a single one of the ten teams over two workshops could fully reproduce the results of the paper. Despite the teams’ inability to reproduce the results, the workshops provided valuable insights into where researchers are falling short in sharing and documenting their data and code. This talk will discuss some of the issues that contributed to the irreproducibility of these papers to provide a better understanding of how researchers can ensure that their science is transparent and reproducible.",https://ischool.umd.edu/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/Staff_Pics/federer_lisa.jpg?itok=g0HxfY75,informationista,lisafederer

Making the process of contribution and participation in research software projects more inclusive and welcoming for a diverse audience will lead to the software better for all researchers. The complexity and domain specificity of research software poses unique challenges for community building and external contributions. How can we help researchers and Research Software Engineers  make their projects more inclusive for the users and contributors with different backgrounds? I hope to share some insight I gained working with different communities in the open science, research and data spaces, from global movements like the Carpentries and Mozilla Open Leaders, to local hacky hours, study groups and Reprohacks.

We are an open source project with contributors from civil society organizations, educational institutions, and private sector companies, and are a fiscally sponsored project of Code for Science & Society. Our mission is to Measure the Internet, save the data, and make it universally accessible and useful. M-Lab works to advance network research and empowers the public with useful information about broadband and mobile connections by maintaining a scalable, global platform for conducting internet measurements, and by supporting an ecosystem of external partners and users around the world interested in using the resulting open data. Our users are researchers, activists, analysts, journalists, experiment developers, hosting providers, regulators, municipalities, and every day consumers. M-Lab works to enhance internet transparency, and help to promote and sustain a healthy, innovative internet by supporting our users in their research and data analyses, developing and publicizing new use cases for our datasets, forming collaborative partnerships, and building open source measurement tools. Last year we introduced our platform and data to csvconf; this year we would like to introduce the project to those who are new to the community as well as dive deeper into our open source alternative for on-premise measurement devices that contribute to our public data set. We would also like to share our community engagement methodology, in hopes of starting a discussion around how to best make data open through accessibility and usability.

wteal,Wesley Teal,More than manuscripts: Transforming special collections materials into ornithological data,"In 2016, the Iowa State University Library was awarded a CLIR grant to digitize several ornithological collections that were part of our special collections to create avIAn: Avian Archive of Iowa Online. What made this project unique was that in addition to creating a fairly traditional digital collection, we would also build a data set out of rare bird sighting documentation, transforming an inaccessible paper archive into online data for anyone to use. This talk will give an overview of how a team of library staff without ornithological expertise tackled the task of building a public data set.",,wtee,@beardbrarian
speruzzo,Serena Peruzzo,Improving law interpretability using NLP,"Laws define how people may or may not behave in society, but are often hard to interpret and inaccessible to the public. Data Scientists from Bardess, in collaboration with a research group from the Government of Ontario, have investigated how NLP can be applied to understand linguistic patterns in legislative texts and extract information that is meaningful for the public. The methodology developed provides us with a framework for representing legal texts that can be used to simplify the way information in the law is accessed and, at the same time, inform legislators on how to write more clear and accessible legislation by highlighting parts of the law that are particularly hard to interpret.",https://photos.app.goo.gl/eWqAx2UcA3c1UxeeA,sereprz,sereprz
msantos,Melissa Santos,Time-to-Event Analysis for Non-Medical Applications,"How do you estimate the time until an event, especially if the event might never happen? The statistical methods for this come from studying time from disease diagnosis to death, but we can use these methods for much more cheerful data. For example, how long does a subscription customer continue to pay you? How long does it take from someone commenting on your open source code to becoming a contributor? How long does it take from the user being seen the first time to them becoming a paid customer?  Kaplan-Meier survival curves are a non-parametric estimates of the time to an event. They make no assumptions about the distribution of the time to the event, and they handle samples of various ages that may or may not have made it to the event. As well as the theory of these, we'll dive into how to calculate them directly in SQL. To finish, I'll share some ways we've been using Kaplan-Meier curves to make decisions at a Software as a Service company. ",,,ansate
