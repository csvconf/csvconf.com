rkemper,Rudo Kemper,Mapping and safeguarding indigenous oral histories using an open source tool,"For many indigenous and other local communities in the rainforests of South America, survival in the rainforest has always depended on an intimate knowledge of their territory, passed down by their ancestors. Place-based stories help determine where food or resources are located, or where dangers lie hidden. Most importantly, the oral histories reinforce their historical and cultural connection to their homelands, which in turn informs their collective identity. However, in the contemporary context, oral history storytelling traditions are at risk of disappearing as younger community members leave their villages recurrently or permanently, in search of work. To prevent invaluable oral histories from disappearing into oblivion, we developed a methodology and built a FOSS application to help communities map their oral histories. Terrastories was born in 2018 after realizing the need for an offline-first geostorytelling tool that can work in very remote conditions such as the Amazon rainforest, and give communities the power to manage their own traditional knowledge and storytelling data. I will share how the project was born and why indigenous peoples needed this tool, how Terrastories works, and discuss some tough questions around data sovereignty, protection of sensitive data, and archiving traditional knowledge.",rkemper,rudokemper,rudokemper
ali,Angela Li,Data Communities and Those Who Build Them,"In order to support the use of data in various contexts, it is important to have champions who demonstrate the value of tools, shepherd new users, and provide support to those learning to use data. In this talk, I’ll cover my experiences with data community building and share strategies from open source communities such as R-Ladies and The Carpentries, as well as the spatial data science community I support at my research center. I’ll discuss the value of the data community builder and their role within / outside of institutions for encouraging uptake of technical tools. Some of the skills needed for these roles may not be what you think: building relationships, being empathetic toward use cases (and users!), organizing events, teaching effectively, and setting strategy for expanding data networks, among others.

Whether you’re a journalist, a business owner, a government official, an activist, a researcher or a student, knowing how to access the right data, transform them into information and leverage its insights for decision-making and action has become a life skill. Take a journey with me as we travel to and alongside several data community members working in low-income context and hear  experiences of how their “low-tech” (LOW-TECHnical knowledge and LOW-TECHnological tools/resources) contexts, are elevating and challenging gaps in the current data community and driving opportunities to rethink and shape how the data community can make data skills and tools accessible to more.",dsopoku,sdopoku,sdopoku
pashlock,Philip Ashlock,The State of Open Government Data Infrastructure,"This talk will provide an overview of the current state of open government data infrastructure and the broader ecosystem from the perspective of Data.gov and the implementation of open data laws in the United States. This will cover the widespread use of the W3C DCAT metadata standard across all Federal agencies as well as widespread use by state and local governments. This same metadata also helps generate the Schema.org variant of the specification with fuels listings on general purpose platforms like Google Dataset Search. The European Union has been updating their DCAT Application Profile with the recent development of DCAT 2.0 and the US Government will be revising its DCAT specification to meet updated requirements in the new comprehensive open data law (""Evidence Act"") with public input on GitHub. This talk will provide an overview of the current state of this infrastructure and ecosystem and ponder how other metadata standards including CSVW, Tabular Data Packages, DSPL, and SDMX fit into the mix as well as how we can better leverage CSVs and tabular data tools and capabilities within platforms like Data.gov and other CKAN-based data catalogs. Since this talk should be in the midst of the public comment period for revising our USG-focused profile of DCAT, it will also be a good opportunity to solicit comments and public participation in the update to the metadata specification used across all government agencies.

They also have a lot of aging junk: little-used datasets with cryptic titles and scant documentation. The library domain has years of experience “weeding” out under-used or outdated materials, and our team brought that perspective to the Washington State open data portal (data.wa.gov/browse). But weeding open data turned out to be pretty complicated. What counts as “low quality” or “little” use? Who makes the weeding decision, in a publishing environment that’s usually decentralized and managed anonymously? How do portals, created for transparency, remove content in a transparent way? We examined nearly all U.S. state and many U.S. city government portals and found very few formal data removal policies -- a void that raises questions about authority, usability and management, as many civic data portals enter their second decade. Supported by the Open Data Literacy project (https://odl.ischool.uw.edu/), this work is contributing to a new open data curation partnership between the Washington State Library and the state’s data portal. The talk will cover our findings, recommendations from archivists and other public records experts, and how the Washington State Library and state agencies are working together to improve open data resources for the public.",,,

jpevans,James Perry Evans,Protected health information breaches on GitHub,"Medical scientists are encouraged to use GitHub for software development, but without training, they might leak protected health information (PHI) by inadvertently including data in what should be software-only repositories. During the fall of 2016, we attempted to identify obvious breaches of PHI on GitHub as part of an ongoing interest in patient privacy. Searching GitHub for keywords patient, dob, and ssn uncovered hundreds of repositories, which were further scanned for sensitive information (names, organizations, phone numbers, street addresses, credit cards, IPs, SSNs, and emails) using Python's common regex module and the Stanford Natural Language Toolkit. Manual investigation of the results uncovered four repositories that exposed patient information. 1) A popular health care provider exposed approximately 4000 patient names. On Dec 1, we were able to track down the healthcare provider from both the repository name and doctor names in the repository files. We contacted the organization and those repositories were taken down within the day of contact. 2) A health collection agency’s repository led to the exposure of social security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses, email addresses, and insurance and billing information of roughly 30,000 patients. After we contacted the repository owner, the data and the repository were removed from GitHub some six months after the data had first been exposed. 3) A crisis center’s long-term breach of PHI was discovered in August 2016, and from the repository commit dates, it had been up for at least three years. The original repository managed the medical records application developed for the crisis center. We contacted that organization and the repository was taken down within a few days. 4) A contractor for a health insurance wellness program leaked some patient data with names, social security numbers, addresses, and health measures such as blood pressure. This organization was contacted by our hospital compliance office and the GitHub repository was removed. Our talk will cover the discovery of these PHI breaches, and how we handled them with GitHub, our hospital compliance office, and the organizations involved.",jpevans,samesense,oncolytic

While many formal courses, both online and in-person, are available to learners, typical methods of learning are acquiring knowledge on-the-job and participating in short-term workshops. While these non-traditional contexts are highly successful, instructors are challenged to capitalize on a limited amount of time and resources, while catering to learners of different backgrounds and experience levels. In this talk, we will discuss how pedagogic research can be applied to computing and programming education in non-traditional settings (e.g., corporate training, 1-day workshops, and one-on-one mentorship).

sctho,Salina Cheuk Ting Ho,Decision making in 'successful' data analysis,"As the tech world continues to abstract away complexities and realities into proxy metrics, data and analysis can present itself as objective and builds a reputation of legitimacy. However, in practice there are many dynamics to data analysis that contribute to the determination of whether an analysis is ‘successful’ or not, many of which exists outside of the data itself. This is why the same regression model can be accepted as ‘successful’ in one context but not in another. Understanding the interplays between data and different factors can help analysts strategize to deliver a ‘successful’ analysis, such as applying design-thinking, storytelling, and empathy techniques. Many discussions within the data community have taken place regarding these techniques and its importance, but few have discuss the ethical impact of such techniques – what are the implications if an analysis crafted through a specific lens is ‘successful’? This talk will go through the various dynamics that contribute to a ‘successful’ analysis, and how intentional decision making at each level of these dynamics is important in data analysis.

At some nodes, we also plan to include annotated data in the form of .csv files (data tables) and .ipynb files (Jupyter notebooks), which serve to provide information about sample data for a topical domain, or for more theoretical topics what the data should look like (pseudo-data). Frontier Maps also serve the purpose of providing minimal information needed to understand jargon and advanced topics in fields unfamiliar to the user.
