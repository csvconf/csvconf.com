ebecker,Erin Becker,Empowering people by democratizing data skills,,ErinSBecker,," Although petabytes of data are now available, most scientific disciplines are failing to translate this sea of data into scientific advances. The missing step between data collection and research progress is a lack of training for scientists in crucial skills for effectively and reproducibly managing and analyzing large amounts of data. Already faced with a deluge of data, researchers themselves are demanding this training and need to learn while on-the-job. They require training that is immediate, accessible, appropriate for their level and relevant to their domain. This training needs to include not only technical skills, but ways of thinking about data to provide learners with the knowledge of what is possible along with the confidence to continue self-guided learning. Short, intensive, hands-on Software and Data Carpentry workshops give researchers the opportunity to engage in deliberate practice as they learn these skills, starting with strong foundational skills and receiving feedback as they learn. This model has been shown to be effective, with the vast majority (more than 90%), of learners saying that participating in the workshop was worth their time and led to improvements in their data management and data analysis skills. We have trained over 20,000 learners since 2014 on 6 continents with over 700 volunteer instructors, with the goal of providing effective training that empowers researchers to turn data into knowledge and discovery."
mhertzfeld,Michelle Hertzfeld,Designing with data: prototyping at the speed of learning,https://michellehertzfeld.com/assets/img/michelle_hertzfeld.jpg,meiqimichelle,,"We've all done it. Mocked up a perfect dashboard with evenly-spaced bars on the bar charts, each with a readable label because of course all the bars are big enough for that. All the boxes look so nice, evenly spaced. Then, in comes the data, and it's a jungle out there! The biggest value on the bar chart is huge, rendering the rest of the bars unreadable. We forgot to design for what we thought were mere edge cases (data-equals-zero versus data-equals-no-data, anyone?). Everything lining up evenly still? Ha! With some labels coming in at one word, and others hefting across at seven, forget it! ...But it doesn't have to be this way. I'm going to tell you about the user-research- and data-driven design and prototyping process that created https://useiti.doi.gov/. By creating a team prototyping process that moved from testing core ideas in words and quick data prototypes; to making more robust, visually-designed prototypes to test with core users; to incorporating those learnings back into the next prototypes and research plans, we were able to enjoy a team flow that created designs that fit the data, and data that communicated clearly. A++, would employ process again."
dwhalen,Danny Whalen,The evolution of a GTFS data pipeline,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/507955752346976256/o7jSxiIT.jpeg,invisiblefunnel,,"The General Transit Feed Specification is one of the primary formats that public transit agencies use to communicate changes to their systems. The specification is simple and flexible, leaving much to be interpreted by the publisher. In order to build a GTFS data pipeline that is similarly flexible you need to understand what makes a particular transit system unique from others, and how those differences are expressed through through the data standard. I‚Äôd like to share stories of a few fascinating transit systems and the wonderful people that work hard to share them with the world. (This is a big part of what we do at Remix.)"

In an era when the largest technology companies have established urban think tanks which seek to develop modes of urban governance by algorithm, the talk aims to reveal the ways that sources of data often invisibly, and perniciously, shape public policy through the methods behind their collection. The dataset ‚Äì the ‚ÄòU.S. Postal Service Vacancy Survey‚Äô ‚Äì is collected by US postal workers on their daily routes delivering mail and was used to help determine which cities received federal aid in the aftermath of the 2008 foreclosure crisis. At each home or business on her route, a mail carrier notes whether a house is occupied (whether the occupants have been picking up their mail). The residences left empty for 90 days or longer are represented in this dataset. The USPS Vacancy Survey powerfully reveals the logic of abstraction at work in all ‚Äúdata‚Äù‚Äîin this case, the ‚Äúnational vacancy rate‚Äù is an abstraction that is both fully dependent on and masks the daily routines of individual postal workers making observations about specific bundles of mail left to languish.

wlyon,William Lyon,Analyzing The Trumpworld Graph: Applying Network Analysis to Public Data,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/502931400882794496/Dy9gq9V2.jpeg,lyonwj,,"A few weeks ago BuzzFeed released a public dataset of people and organizations connected to Donald Trump and members of his administration. As they say in their blog post announcing the data:

    No American president has taken office with a giant network of businesses,    investments, and corporate connections like that amassed by Donald J. Trump. His family and advisers have touched a staggering number of ventures, from a hotel in Azerbaijan to a poker company in Las Vegas.

In this talk we will show how to model this data as a graph, write Cypher queries to find interesting connections and visualize the results. In addition, we will show how to add public data from USASpending.gov on government contracts and campaign finance from the FEC, allowing us to answer questions like:

* How are members of the Trump administration connected to vendors of government contracts?

* Who are the most influential people in the network and how are they connected to Trump?"
mpclaypotch,Matt 'Potch' Claypotch,A Better 'Edit' Button for GitHub-Hosted Data,http://bits.potch.me/headshot.jpg,potch,,GitHub is a fantastic way to encourage collaboration on your work and more than ever people put their data in text-based formats on GitHub.

npenfold,Naomi Penfold,Innovation to facilitate data sharing in the life sciences and biomedicine,https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_a2JekZMrW8LW5TdUdhMjZvZGs,eLifeInnovation,,"The drive for more open data in the life sciences and biomedical research is supported by research funders and policymakers as a means to address the ‚Äòreproducibility crisis‚Äô, derive more value from research projects, and avoid duplication of effort in research. Journal and funder policies encouraging the deposition of datasets in repositories, where appropriate, help to enforce data-sharing practises but do not ensure that the data itself is of sufficient quality. The physics, computer science, and computational biology communities have developed tools that facilitate the publication of reproducible computational analysis, but these are geared at users with a high degree of digital literacy. For biologists who rely on basic spreadsheets and desktop statistical analysis software, the barrier to entry to these tools remains high. Further, the effort required to translate a myriad of data objects into a well-curated dataset for deposition is not directly paired to the benefits that may come from sharing such data.

At eLife, we are interested in tools and technologies that will help and incentivise life science and biomedical researchers to share their data more openly. We are actively seeking and showcasing open-source tools, such as Binder, that augment the static research article with richer, dynamic and reproducible artefacts, and cater for biologists in doing so. We are also interested in processes that reduce the work required to share datasets, improve their discovery, facilitate their reuse, and pair the effort of sharing with meaningful rewards, such as credit, citation, and reputation gain. In this talk, I will discuss specific examples where data sharing has gained traction in the biology community, and outline key pain points remaining. I invite the community to join me in a conversation about how research technologists and publishers can best contribute towards open data in the life sciences and biomedicine."

One set of time-consuming tasks is data integration; that is, bridging gaps of incompatibility to merge datasets from different sources. Even datasets in the same format may refer to the same conceptual entity with different language. The way to solve this problem is to connect datasets via their metadata. Much progress has been made in metadata standards, practices, and formats (CSV on the Web a.k.a. WCSV, Ecological Metadata Language (EML), and JSON-Linked Data). However, much data lacks robust metadata due to the limits of manual metadata curation. We propose an automated approach to metadata discovery that aims to facilitate data discovery and linking, joining, and merging of heterogeneous datasets. We outline the challenges to this problem and our strategy for addressing them, including a set of machine-learning classifiers and heuristics to identify the correct ontology or ontologies for fields and entities in datasets (e.g., location names, species taxonomies), and link these data across data sets with different sources and formats. We discuss how this tool can fit into scientific workflows and an open data ecosystem."

In this talk we will explore methods of extracting location and time trends from data - and plotting that data and extracting meaning for our users beyond just location.  We will cover everything from hot-spot analysis vs heat maps to plotting location trends over time and even filtering common locations.  We'll also take a special look at some Google Location History to figure out what types of information we can extract from knowing where a person has been before and what we can predict from it.

But when that data is collected and shared by the institution itself, they are in a powerful position to control the narrative. 

What can we as data practitioners do to help identify potentially biased narratives that could exist in this type of data? Because blindly trusting a biased dataset is just as harmful as blindly trusting a biased source.

I would like to talk a little about a vetting process, and about a few important types of biases in data that you should have in mind. This list is by no means complete and is still a work in progress, but it includes some of the more major types of bias that I‚Äôve noticed in data, and what I think you can do about them."
hparker,Hilary Parker,Opinionated Analysis Development,https://goo.gl/photos/C7Rxys6qGeLfs3xp8,hspter,,"Traditionally, statistical training has focused primarily on mathematical derivations and proofs of statistical tests. The process of developing the technical artifact -- that is, the paper, dashboard, or other deliverable -- is much less frequently taught, presumably because of an aversion to cookbookery or prescribing specific software choices. In this talk, I argue that it's critical to teach generalized opinions for how to go about developing an analysis in order to maximize the probability that an analysis is reproducible, accurate and collaborative. By encouraging the use of and fluency in tooling that implements these opinions, we as a community can foster the growth of processes that fail the practitioners as infrequently as possible."

In an attempt to realize alternative visions of data's future, communities are working to build decentralized applications that avoid exploitation and fragility. These applications, however, largely concern the storing and sharing of data, with no general platform for decentralized applications having taken root. This talk explores the idea of a commune cloud as a general solution to the centralization of both data and its processing. What is a commune cloud? Why might we want one? What might it look like?

Good ontology development requires deep knowledge from domain experts, but the tools for building ontologies can be cumbersome and unintuitive. In many such contexts, domain experts revert to use of the plethora of csv-based tools. Fundamentally, the problem then becomes how to best utilize tools to enable domain-specific concept visualization, table-based editing, and to output semantically consistent computable artifacts for use in software applications and data analytics. Here we explain our approach to viewing and editing ontologies within a lightweight spreadsheet-style web application (https://github.com/INCATools/table-editor). This presentation will be given by a domain expert and the tool developer as a demonstration of the team science required to realize the dream of good ontologies."
rfischer,Roger Fischer,In search for the ideal csv template to map elections,http://liftconference.com/sites/default/files/person/RogerFischer.jpg,datamapio,,"Currently nobody has a correct election map below the state level for last year's presidential election. Unfortunately this also makes it easy to throw around wild claims of voter fraud. We at Datamap started on the journey to solve this problem. There are 3142 counties in the US, so there is a lot of work to do. Let's get started!"
rsingh,Raj Singh,Mapping Data in Jupyter Notebooks with Pixiedust,,rajrsingh,,"The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. The Jupyter stack is built from the ground up to be extensible and hackable. The Developer Advocacy team at IBM Watson has developed an open source library of useful time-saving and anxiety reducing tools we call ""Pixiedust"". It was designed to ease the pain of charting, **importing CSVs into Spark**, saving data to the cloud, and exposing Python data structures to Scala code. I'll talk about how I built mapping into Pixiedust, putting data from Spark-based analytics on maps.

Attendees will learn how to programmatically extend Jupyter Notebooks, the Mapbox API, and combining Python with JavaScript using the Jinja2 Python template engine. You will also learn how to use Pixiedust to automate some of the drudgery of data exploration, and get a gentle introduction to joining the Pixiedust developer community.

jheeffer,Jasper Heeffer,DDF: Gapminder's data model for collaborative harmonization of multidimensional statistics.,http://jasperheeffer.nl/me.jpg,jasperheeffer,,"At Gapminder we spread a fact-based worldview everyone can understand. Our fact base is largely statistics. For us to compare and visualize statistics from many sources, we need to harmonize the data, both syntactically and semantically. Our solution is an automized toolset around a data model called DDF. The model aims to be both human and machine readable, contains a query language, is format-agnostic (though our main format is csv) and it is flexible enough for anyone to fit their data in. The toolset contains solutions for Data QA, a declarative scripting language to transform and merge datasets, a data reader for our visualization framework Vizabi, a database server and more. We'd love to show it to you and get your feedback to make it even better! It's all open source!"
yalnoamany,Yasmin AlNoamany,Using Web Archives to Enrich the Live Web Experience Through Storytelling,,,,"Archiving Web pages into themed collections is a method for ensuring these resources are available for posterity. Services such as Archive-It exist to allow institutions to develop, curate, and preserve collections of Web resources. Understanding the contents and boundaries of these archived collections is a challenge for most people, resulting in the paradox of the larger the collection, the harder it is to understand. Meanwhile, as the sheer volume of data grows on the Web, ""storytelling"" is becoming a popular technique in social media for selecting Web resources to support a particular narrative or ""story"". I‚Äôll explain a proposed framework that integrates ""storytelling"" social media and Web archives. In the framework, we identify, evaluate, and select candidate Web pages from archived collections that summarize the holdings of these collections, arrange them in chronological order, and then visualize these pages using tools that users already are familiar with, such as Storify.

How much involved is the civil society and community in the process?  What are the challenges in opening data in Mexico?

This talk will narrate the story of implementing the open contracting data standard in Secretaria de Finanzas in Mexico City.  This was the beginning of the implementation in Mexico and one of the first initiatives in opening public contracts in a city level."
howens,Hunter Owens,Towards a Taxonomy of Government Data,,hunter_owens,,"Working with data for a local government means that you spend a non-trivial amount of time trying to find data. This talk introduces a taxonomy of gov data for US governments that helps us find data that we need to provide services for residents of the 2nd largest city in the United States. In the talk, I hope to explain how to think about government data and access it. Additionally, we will talk about what meta-portals and other resources are available for collecting information about your community. "
dphiffer,Dan Phiffer,The world is weird and wonderful!,https://phiffer.org/etc/dphiffer.jpg,dphiffer,,"It starts from a simple premise: flat text files are the most stable format, and GeoJSON seems like a reasonable way to encode geographic descriptions of places. Let‚Äôs say ALL of the places in the world‚Äîcontinents, time zones, countries, cities, venues, voting constituencies, a large rock on a hill that got painted to look like the poop emoji that one time‚Äîevery place we can find online in an open license or create ourselves as Creative Commons-zero. The project is called Who's On First, and my job is to develop the web-based editor for it, called Boundary Issues. This talk covers a summary of the Who's On First project generally, and some of the challenges and quirks of working with ~26 million text files managed in git repositories (hosted at github.com/whosonfirst-data)."
mposner,Miriam Posner,Data in the Humanities Classroom,http://miriamposner.com/images/Miriam.jpg,miriamkp,,"Data specialists might be surprised to learn that students are increasingly working with data in college humanities classes. In UCLA's Digital Humanities classes, we assign our students a wide range of data sets, which they explore, refine, research, visualize, and map. (See, for example: http://nyphilcollection.com/.) The goal is to balance data analysis with open-ended humanities inquiry, and a number of other DH programs are also picking up this pedagogical strategy. We're all constantly searching for awesome datasets for our students. I'd like to talk about what our students do with data, and I'd also like to explain how people can build datasets that are ""student-ready"" for the digital humanities classroom."

And you probably can't do much worse than that guy a Amazon who thinks you need to buy more garbage cans after buying one. Scikit-learn is the Python library for machine learning. It is well-tested, well-supported, and well-documented - complete with thorough examples. Using a simple data file and a Jupyter notebook, we will follow an example program and inspect the data in each step. After this talk, you'll be comfortable exploring, transforming, and modeling simple datasets in Python. "
