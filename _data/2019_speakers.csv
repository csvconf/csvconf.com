gkanunnikau,Gleb Kanunnikau,Digging for Urban and Civic Data in Eastern Europe,gkanunnikau,,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2827562#.XNyBRuTtruE,https://youtu.be/MM8pEvUPId0,"The Open Data and Open Knowledge movement in developing countries is constantly bumping against the paradoxical question: is there a way to open up data when the datasets aren't yet present? Where do you get the data to make your effort worthwhile and how do you scale to make the initiative relevant to the larger society? More importantly, do the data producers (the state bodies and the surveillance apparatus, social networks or municipal service providers) share the interest of publishing data for everyone's and society's benefit? Is there a way to dig out interesting and relevant datasets that people didn't know existed to show new ways to analyze and fight urban problems, educate people about the environment, propose solutions to post-Soviet problems like unemployment, decaying public infrastructure, never-digitized cultural assets? Do we cooperate with the fashionable ""Smart city"" projects funded by Chinese state corporations or remain vary of the surveillance methods they introduce in cooperation with the police and other government structure? Practical cases, civic hacking and citizen data science, establishing cooperation between unlikely partners and other questions of interest for anyone interested in the community building process from scratch."

This presents significant challenges for equity. This panel discussion will explore the first two free/libre open source qualitative analysis tools out there: qcoder (R package) and Taguette (desktop application). Drawing from the diverse backgrounds of the presenters (social science, library & information science, software engineering), we will discuss what openness and extensibility means for qualitative research, and how the two tools we've built facilitate equitable, open sharing."

This potential wealth of data for research comes practical problems such as: How to merge data streams? And how can people responsibly share their personal information? In this talk we will explore how to enable responsible personal data sharing by giving individuals granular sharing options and how this can enable community science. Furthermore, we will also see how we can scale up personal data exploration from the n-of-one to an n-of-many-ones, using a JupyterHub setup built right into a community science platform."

The BCO-DMO data repository used FD tools on real-world datasets, and we have some lessons learned to share. By building upon existing FD tools, we found ways to reduce the amount of time data managers spend generating metadata, and writing custom scripts.  We are also developing ways for data managers with varying levels of scripting ability to make use of Frictionless Data tools. "
jlowndes,Julia Lowndes,Building Communities of Practice around Environmental Open Data Science,jlowndes,juliesquid,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KXzPId1IvspsemIOmOUQEOqt8-Nw4Lhb2-Xvi_XZWeU/edit,https://youtu.be/njFaGA7Cs2M,"Environmental scientists are a diverse community that ranges from climatologists to geneticists, but we are united by an enormous need to work efficiently with data – and by the fact that we seldom have formal computing or data analysis training of any kind. There is great opportunity to borrow from the work of software engineers and use collaborative open tools that facilitate better science in less time. However, a fundamental shift is needed in the environmental science community that prioritizes data science and provides emerging scientific leaders training in open science tools and practices to strengthen and accelerate their work. I will discuss my work to catalyze this shift through two programs I have developed and lead at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California at Santa Barbara. The first is the Ocean Health Index training program, which teaches international government and academic scientists how to channel the best available scientific information into marine policy using our scientific method and tools. And the second I have recently launched in January 2019 as a Mozilla Fellow: Openscapes, a mentorship program that empowers environmental scientists with open data science tools and grows the community of practice."
mmejia,Melissa Mejia,The Data to Policy Project: Using Data to Build More Equitable Communities,mmejia,,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2691398#.XNV3eIIyMX4,,"The Data to Policy Project (D2P) is an initiative creating meaningful learning experiences for students by using analysis of open data to generate equity and evidence-based policy proposals addressing local community needs. D2P is integrated into credit-bearing courses where students explore issues like policing and affordable housing in the Denver region. Over the course of a semester, students find, cite, clean, analyze, and visualize data to identify gaps or problems in policing or affordable housing, create policy proposals that address what they found, then create a research poster to communicate their findings. We encourage a critical approach to data literacy that questions the objectivity and neutrality of data and situate it in a socio-political context. The project culminates in a D2P Symposium where students present their research to their peers, faculty, staff, and community members. By focusing on student-initiated concerns and using real data to try and address them, D2P forms a connection between the courses students take and the communities they live in, increasing its meaning and impact. We also partner with local community organizations, governments, and nonprofits to identify and frame the research questions students explore. Our goal is to intentionally include community voices so that the research we work on is relevant, context-specific, and in the interest of the community it will impact. This presentation will communicate the challenges and benefits of this kind of work, how it can be replicated in other contexts, and invite feedback on how to improve the project."
mparker,Micaela Parker,Data Science Training and Community Building through Hackweeks,mparker,,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2750895#.XNiPmUxi9hA,,"Informal training activities enable researchers at all levels to rapidly learn data science tools and best practices that fit their research questions and make significant advances in their work. In this talk, I will describe a highly successful informal training that has emerged in recent years called Hackweeks. These hackathon-style events place a strong focus on cultivating data science literacy, building a community of practice, and developing resources within an existing domain-specific community. By bringing together researchers from many different universities to address methods challenges within a research domain, Hackweeks take advantage of a shared language and shared scientific objectives. The Hackweek structure is designed to foster collaboration and learning among people from various stages of their career and technical abilities, and catalyze a community through a shared interest in solving computational challenges within a field (Huppenkothen et al, 2018). Hackweeks originally came out of the Astronomy community (Astro Hack Week, entering its 6th year in 2019) and the model has been successfully propagated to: neuroscience (Neurohackweek, now a 2-week NIH-funded program called Neurohackademy), geospatial sciences (Geohackweek), oceanography (Oceanhackweek), and more.

jmhernandez,Jose M Hernandez,Version Controlled Stakeholder Reporting: Building an End-to-End Data Reporting Infrastructure,jmhernandez,josemhe,,,"King County, Washington is currently undergoing complex social and economic changes that have both positive and negative impacts on local residents. With rising rents displacing  low-income households to outlying areas or into homelessness, there is a critical need to understand the prevalence and mechanisms of housing insecurity for government organizations tasked to address these issues. Currently, our team of Data and social scientists at the University of Washington, eScience Institute are collaborating with stakeholders across the King County Housing and Homelessness prevention agencies to derive meaningful insights from their data. While their aim is not to produce academic research, our findings may have significant and immediate impact for their organizational practices and the communities they are tasked to serve. In this context and where there is an iterative and constant feedback loop present, reproducibility of the results we present to them, from figures, tables, and even written language is critical. To ensure a successful collaboration, our team has built an end to end data reporting infrastructure to produce reports for our stakeholders that are reproducible and version controlled from raw data to final product. We employ some common open source tools to accomplish this, including R/Rstudio, Python, Rmarkdown, and git."

In this talk, we discuss our experience with ""Data Scavenger Hunts"" using web apps to democratize data science and make it accessible to a wide variety of audiences. In order to acheive this, we have developed an R package called `burro` that can enable public datasets to be explored together via a sharable web app. In this talk, we talk about our experience with using data scavenger hunts to teach each other interesting things about data. In particular, we share our experiences with exploring the NHANES (National Health Nutirition Examination Survey) data and the insights we have taught each other. We show that this guided and communal data exploration leads to increased confidence and curiosity about data science in Biodata-Club, our learning community. `burro` apps can be deployed by anyone to start conversations about data."

M-Lab works to enhance internet transparency, and help to promote and sustain a healthy, innovative internet by supporting our users in their research and data analyses, developing and publicizing new use cases for our datasets, forming collaborative partnerships, and building open source measurement tools. In this talk we will introduce the M-Lab platform with the csvconf audience, share how our open data and open source tools are being used by communities around the world, and provide resources on how attendees might use them as well."
tallard,Dr. Tania Allard,Where Has Your Data Come From? Data Ancestry and Other Tales,tallard,ixek,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2697993#.XNV15C3lHA0,https://youtu.be/xBbLP00GNAA,"Over the last few years, great improvements have been made around the areas of reproducible scientific computing research and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data.  As a consequence, data scientists and researchers alike have started to incorporate modern software development practices in their workflows (i.e. version control, testing). More and more emphasis has been made on the need to look after the quality and validity of the software developed. But what about the data? Data validation and integrity is just as important as the adequacy of the code ingesting and processing the datasets. 
In this talk, I will take a high-level look at concepts such as data lineage, provenance, continuous data validation and present real-world examples in which these concepts have been applied to different real-world data pipelines increasing not only the confidence of the results obtained but also the efficiency and integrity of the workflows themselves.

rmallinga,Rachel Mallinga,Data Analysis to Improve Diversity and Equity in Graduate-Level Education,rmallinga,,,https://youtu.be/a6KzR9IQk0s,"This project grew from the need to determine what students of diverse backgrounds need to feel welcomed and represented in their graduate department at the University of Oregon. Two women of color took the initiative to conduct qualitative and quantitative research on how equity and diversity are represented in curriculum, services, and departmental resources.  Based on our findings we researched resources on campus that address the problems identified in our data and best practices for graduate education implemented by similar graduate-level programs in Oregon. This talk illustrates how research methods can be used to inform institutional policies and practices to improve diversity and equity."

amorley,Alexander Morley,What's Next After Notebooks?,amorley,alex__morley,https://zenodo.org/record/2771413#.XNiP_y-ZNQI,,"Jane is a data scientist. Jane uses Jupyter notebooks as her working environment, and her presentation environment. These “computational essays” allow Jane to present her methods and her results to her colleagues at the same time. Jane is happy with this. But sometimes it’s difficult for Jane to share notebooks with her colleagues, and even harder for them to re-mix or re-use parts of the notebook, or to share their changes back to Jane. And sometimes Jane finds it hard to explain the flow of a particular notebook, or how different notebooks are tied together. There’s no provision for keeping things modular. First, I will discuss a few up-and-coming projects that are leveraging the power of new web technologies and faster browsers to solve all of fictional Jane’s problems, and more. Second, I will present a prototype for my own solution that is also web-based, and draws inspiration from some now-uncool graphical programming languages."

Yet, their processes and decisions are based around data that is far removed from the community, outdated and/or based on surveys and feedback forums which are generally attended by the same group of people and which can be overtaken by lobbyists. If we want to create cities that place people at the centre, it is essential that we find data about what makes neighbourhoods connected and wholesome, neighbourhoods which provide safe spaces for their community to engage.  Social data (data from social media, crowdsourcing, mapping platforms, review apps, etc) can give us an opportunity to understand how people engage in their communities and interact with the places around them. It can be used to provide insights into the social health of local places and identify vulnerabilities, to feel the heartbeat of the neighbourhood. I will talk about what social data is, some of the challenges of getting it and collating it, the data's strengths and weaknesses, and how we are trying using it to make cities more socially connected."

In the same way, statistical journalism should not be a black box of visualizations and narrative meant only for data makers like us. Crafting data-driven stories for a general audience means giving readers an opportunity to interact with a fun and practical use case while explaining the interpretative thinking that lies under the hood of statistical methods. I am an undergraduate at Cal Poly that writes and builds interactive, data-driven publishings with a team of students.

It’s no secret that the tech and data worlds do not reflect the nation’s diversity.  And for those of us working in Civic Tech or Public Interest Technology, the struggle to secure long-term funding for projects or identify career paths is real.  What if we shifted our mindset from “with a lot of time and a lot of work, we’ll figure it out,” to “let’s experiment and incite change today.”  The time is now to tackle the question: as the data-driven community matures, how does it do so in a way that’s inclusive and sustainable?"
ashernández,Adrian Santuario Hernández,Chromatocracy: The Pantone® of Mexican Social Mobility.,ashernández,AdrianSantuario,,https://youtu.be/AZcDNoGPaVg,"Skin colour ratings have been used in several studies about racial discrimination and racial attitudes but have rarely been used in Mexico. Although since 1917 the Mexican Constitution establish a legal equality of citizens without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion, it is common to see several discrimination on work spaces, educational facilities and government offices based on skin colour. Despite the last surveys leaded for INEGI (National Institute of Geography and Statistics) shows signals of racial discrimination in his reports, a glance at the map will suffice to see clearly that colour skin is an important issue for Mexican social mobility. For example: 95% of the presenters on Mexican TV Shows have 1-3 colour skin tone (Based on PERLA Colour Palette) while 85% of the total Mexican population have 5-7 colour skin tone; that gap on the tones generate an aspirational sentiment of status: whiter is better. To support that correlation between skin color and social mobility I developed a Web Scraping, Machine Learning and Facial Recognition algorithm to answer two questions: Who is more successful in Mexico? (95 percent of CEO tend to have whither color skin (1-3 PERLA) that the rest) and, Are there a correlation between your political affiliation an your tone skin? (Right-wing party (PVEM) is wither that the left-wing party (PRD)). The work demonstrate how technology (Machine Learning Color Algorithm) can help to unravel hidden social dynamics in mexican culture."

While we can generally define sustainability as the inflow of resources is sufficient to do the needed work, where those resources both include and are somewhat transferrable into human effort, users, funders, managers, and developers (or maintainers) all mean somewhat different things when they use sustainable in the context of software. This talk will illustrate some of these different views, and their corresponding aims. It will also provide some guidance on quantifying software sustainability from some of these views."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of altered social and communication difficulties along with repetitive and restrictive behaviors. It is difficult to study a living brain safely which is why we use neuroimaging techniques such as MRI. Data quality can be affected by subjects moving in the scanner, or due to computing pipeline issues. Adjustments to the HCP pipeline lead to an increase in data quality, and a decrease in the amount of data lost. This will save researchers time, money, and data to study the neurophysiological aspects of ASD. "

We are learning that, for the most part, much of the data around these issues don’t exist, which largely reinforces systems of oppression. 
                At Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, OR, a group of people have come together to focus on the lack of representation of historically underrepresented minorities (URM) in science as well as the lack of inclusive culture within OHSU’s graduate programs. Our group is called the Alliance for Visible Diversity in Science (AVDS). We found that data on a variety of topics, e.g. statistics on the number of URM graduate students that are interviewed/accepted/decide to matriculate, and well-designed climate surveys to assess the culture of inclusivity are lacking. This leads to decision-making and policies based on incomplete data that disproportionately hurts already vulnerable populations. For example, many programs require that applicants report their score on a standardized test called the graduate record examination (GRE) despite the fact that research shows that GRE scores are more highly correlated with socioeconomic status than student success. We would like to share what we have learned through the process of forming AVDS: our successes, our challenges, and the imperative idea that we must in part approach social inequity issues with scientific and data-driven approaches."

It includes operating costs and fuel consumption, hourly power output and GHG emissions, and the age and length of natural gas pipelines, the price of electricity every 5 minutes at thousands of nodes in the grid, coal production numbers and much much more. In theory all this data is public and freely available, but in practice it takes a lot of wrangling to make it usable for analysis. The result: it's packaged up by one or two platform monopolies that charge tens of thousands of dollars a year for easy access, excluding most non-corporate users. But for anyone interested in the ongoing transformation of our energy system and its climate impacts, this data is a treasure trove worth excavating. The Public Utility Data Liberation project (https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl) has been working for the last 2.5 years to liberate this data and make it freely accessible to activists, data journalists, and researchers working on US climate and energy policy.

spwanson,Saul Pwanson,How a File Format Led to a Crossword Scandal,spwanson,saulfp,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2836892#.XNyBaUXUB1Y,https://youtu.be/9aHfK8EUIzg,"In 2016 I designed a plain-text file format for crossword puzzle data, and then spent a couple of months building a micro-data-pipeline, scraping tens of thousands of crosswords from various sources.  Then, having all those crosswords in a simple format, I wanted to see if there were any common grid patterns--and discovered egregious plagiarism by a major crossword editor that had gone on for years. This talk would cover the file format, data pipeline, and the design choices that aided rapid exploration; the evidence for the scandal, from the initial anomalies to the final damning visualization; and what it's like for a data project to get 15 minutes of fame."
dkazemi,Darius Kazemi,Squishy Amoeba-Like Objects,dkazemi,tinysubversions,https://zenodo.org/record/3170695#.XOYzUtNKjBJ,,"On June 19th, 1970, a group of computer scientists who were inventing the internet referred to key pieces of its proposed design as ""squishy amoeba-like objects"".  Amoebas are porous yet have well-defined boundaries. Thinking about these creatures gives us new ways to think about networks and communities and technology.  This talk makes a case for the squishy amoeba-like object as an organizing principle for what is broadly being called ""the decentralized web"", a web outside of monolithic, monopolistic actors."
choldgraf,Chris Holdgraf,Open Infrastructure for Open Science: How Binder Powers an Open Stack in the Cloud,choldgraf,choldgraf,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2747641#.XNiPHjM-1-U,,"This talk will discuss the Binder Project in the context of open data and open science, two primary use-cases that have driven the project. It will cover the basics of the Binder Project, such as how to define a reproducible repository to share with others. It will then discuss one of Binder's core goals, which is to build on open standards to facilitate the use of *many* open languages, interfaces, etc. Finally I'll discuss how BinderHub, the technology behind a Binder deployment, is itself open source and deployable anywhere. I'll finish by describing a goal of distributed, federated BinderHubs that provide a network of reproducible data analytics environments."
aterrel,Andy Terrel,Should Real Estate Data be Open?,aterrel,aterrel,,,"While aggregators of multiple listing service (MLS) data have opened up much of the process of finding a house on the internet, the data is still closed. The MLS quotes personal security as the primary reason. What data is being protected and what is the impact of that decision? As a consumer of data from numerous sources, REX has routinely been denied access to this data. In this case we make the case for all the societal benefits for opening this data and the implications."
hdominguez,Hector Dominguez,How open data can promote participatory democracy,hdominguez,hdomaguirre,,,"In this discussion, I will explore the nuances of building an open data program as a step towards participatory democracy and the challenges of creating trust with local communities."
pmcgarry,Patrick McGarry,How to Build a Data-Driven Culture,pmcgarry,scuttlemonkey,,,"The world of modern data teamwork isn't one that can be created by software and business process alone. Individuals will need to alter their behavior, which is the hardest part about change. This talk will examine the traits and behaviors that lead organizations to be truly data-driven."
