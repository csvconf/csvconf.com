# How to get to Puebla?

## Arrival
The two nearest airports to Puebla are Mexico City’s International Airport and Hermanos Serdán Airport in Huejotzingo, Puebla:

## From International Airport of Mexico City
Puebla City is about 130 kilometers from Benito Juarez Mexico City’s [International Airport](https://www.aicm.com.mx/) (AICM) (MEX code), and it should not take more than two hours to travel there by car and three hours by public transportation. The following methods could be used to get to the Center of Puebla from the Mexico City International Airport.

## The cheapest way
[Estrella Roja](https://www.estrellaroja.com.mx/) provides nonstop, first-class bus service to Puebla from Mexico City, including its two terminals inside the airport. The two-hour ride, approximately, includes beverage service, air conditioning, videos, on board internet access, and personalized surround system for music and/or a movie. This bus arrives at both the CAPU (Puebla's central bus station) or the "Paseo Destino" station.

We recommend taking the bus to Paseo Destino because the cabs inside that terminal are safe and it costs approximately $100 pesos (~5 dollars) to get to one of the recommended hotels. However, you can take the bus to the CAPU and take an official cab from the cab stand inside the terminal. Give the dispatcher the address of the hotel, the dispatcher will charge you about $300 pesos (~18 dollars) and assign you a cab number.

## The direct way
You can take an authorized taxi in the Mexico City International Airport, but the cost of a trip directly to Puebla Center at the hotel you will stay is about $2000 pesos (~100 dollars).

Puebla has a small airport, called Hermanos Serdán (PBC). It is located in the nearby town of Huejotzingo, about 40 to 50 minutes from downtown Puebla. Hire an official taxi for $400-$450 pesos (~25 dollars) at the stand inside the terminal. The disadvantage is that all international flights come through Houston, Texas and hence there are fewer options than when flying to Mexico City.

## Traveling from other states of Mexico
If you are already in Mexico, you can take a bus that arrives to CAPU depending on the place you are. The most common lines departing from Mexico City are ADO and Estrella Roja, a detailed list of lines can be found at this link, if you are in another state you can travel to TAPO in Mexico City and then travel to Puebla by ADO or Estrella roja.

## Passports and Visas
Citizens of the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Japan, and some countries of Latin America are not required to obtain visas for short visits (up to 3 months) to Mexico; you will require only a valid passport and a landing card supplied by the airlines. Citizens of most other countries will require a visa obtainable at the nearest Mexican consulate or embassy. In the (unlikely) event that you have problems obtaining a visa, please notify us as soon as possible.

# Venue and city information

The history of the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP) dates back to April 1578, when members of the Society of Jesus founded the College of the Holy Spirit.

# Discover Puebla

## What to see and do in Puebla? 

We hope you enjoy the city during your visit. Here we suggest several activities and places to enjoy during your stay.  

The Zócalo: Of course, the Zócalo is a place you can't miss in Puebla since it is the heart of the historic center and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Since its foundation in the 16th century, it has always been the main square of Puebla, as evidenced by its important buildings (the cathedral, the municipal palace), the restaurants, stores and cafes that surround it. At the Palacio Municipal (Portal Hidalgo 14) you will find tourist information about Puebla with maps, etc.  

The cathedral: whose full name is Catedral de Nuestra Señora de la Inmaculada Concepción, is a place to see in Puebla: it is the second largest cathedral in Mexico. Built between the 16th and 17th centuries, with a Renaissance-style façade and a Baroque interior, it contains numerous paintings, sculptures, gold and silver work, three organs and impressive woodwork. The altar of the Altar of the Kings especially impressed me with its wealth of detail. Monday to Saturday, 9 am to 1 pm and 4 pm to 8 pm. Entrance fee: free of charge  

The Chapel of the Rosary of the Temple of Santo Domingo: (1650-1690), even more impressive than the cathedral of Puebla. It is considered the finest example of Mexican Baroque and it is easy to understand why upon entering: everything here is richly decorated from floor to ceiling, heavily charged and covered with 24-karat gold leaf. Address: 5 de mayo esquina 4 Poniente #101, Puebla. Tuesday to Thursday, 11:00 am to 1:30 pm and 3:00 pm to 5:30 pm, Friday to Saturday, 11:00 am to 1:30 pm and Sunday, 3:00 pm to 5:30 pm. Entrance fee: free of charge  
Biblioteca Palafoxiana: On the second floor of the Casa de Cultura de Puebla, in a magnificent vaulted room, is the Biblioteca Palafoxiana: with its 43,000 volumes (from the 15th to the 20th century), it was the first public library on the American continent. In 1981 the library ceased to be public and became a museum, and today it is an important tourist attraction in Puebla for its history and the beauty of the place. Address: 5 Oriente 5, corner with 16 de septiembre, Puebla. Tue-Thurs 10am to 5pm, Fri-Sun 10am to 6pm. Entrance fee: $45.00 pesos.  

Museo Amparo: Located in a palace and hospital of the colonial era, it houses a large collection of Mexican art: 7 rooms on the pre-Hispanic era, 3 rooms on the viceregal era and the nineteenth century, as well as exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. It has national and international exhibitions. It is a must visit when in Puebla. In the museum you can also access its terrace and enjoy the cafeteria, where you will enjoy a panoramic view of the historic center, ideal for taking pictures. You can enjoy breakfast or lunch. Address: Avenida 2 Sur 708, Downtown, Puebla. Open from Wednesday to Monday from 10:00 hrs. to 18:00 hrs. Entrance fee $85.00 Mexican pesos.   

La Calle de los Dulces: Calle 6 Oriente, nicknamed Calle de los Dulces (or Calle del Dulce) in the historic center. Here you will find different traditional sweets of Puebla, such as: sweet potatoes, macaroons, muégano, jamoncillo, borrachitos, cocadas, coconut stuffed lemons, alegrías and Santa Clara cakes. We recommend a visit to La Gran Fama, the first confectionery that opened in the 19th century, and to Dulcería Santa Clara, another Puebla institution, open since 1907.  

El Parián handicraft market: this is the best place in Puebla to buy talaveras (and even handicrafts in general) as there are many shops selling all kinds of traditional crafts, talaveras, leather, textiles, jewelry, sweets, ceramics, wooden objects, etc. It is considered the first handicraft market in Puebla, its history dates back to 1760. Address: Calle 6 Norte #205, Puebla. Open every day from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm.  
El callejón de los sapos: it owes its name to a flood: it is said that, in colonial times, the San Francisco river overflowed regularly, causing floods. Some people decided to take advantage of the situation by installing mills, which ended up attracting many toads due to the stagnant water. Today, it is a small pedestrian street lined with restaurants, cafes, bars and stores. On Friday and Saturday nights it is a good place to have a drink and listen to music, but Sunday is the best day: from 10 a.m. it is the big market with antiques, handicrafts and all kinds of objects. Address: México 6, México 83, 72017 Heroica Puebla de Zaragoza, Pue.
