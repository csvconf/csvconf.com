## An Important Note on Navigation

The city is divided into [four quadrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrants_of_Washington,_D.C.) (which describe your position relative to the Capitol). Lettered streets run East-West. Numbered streets run North-South. Streets named after states run diagonally across this “grid.” See the diagrams [on this page](https://badercondominium.org/Bader_Streets.html). The event venue is in the Northwest, which is the largest quadrant.

# Transportation

[Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/dc) will help you navigate your transportation options.

The venue is a ten-minute walk away from the Dupont Circle (Red Line), Farragut North (Red Line), and Farragut West (Blue/Orange/Silver Lines) Metro stations.

A [one or three-day unlimited Metro Pass](https://smartrip.wmata.com/Storefront) may be worthwhile if you plan to make extensive use of public transportation. Subway fares depend on how far you travel and whether you ride during peak hours. Buses are $2.00.

[Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/) is a great way to see the city. (If you happen to have the Lyft app on your phone, you can use it to rent bikes).

Uber and Lyft both operate in the city.
